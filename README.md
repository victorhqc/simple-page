## About
Nothing really useful. Just me learining about [gotham](https://gotham.rs/),
[hyper](https://hyper.rs/), [tokio](https://tokio.rs/) and Async programming in Rust in general.
I'm pretty new to [Futures](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/07/04/Rust-1.36.0.html#the-future-is-here)
but it's super interesting.

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0SIcN-Y-LA) to understand how it all works.
